HOW TO USE THE MICROCODE ASSEMBLER

Start SLIME:

  M-x slime

Load the assembler (replace string by correct path):

  (push "/home/oystein/ntnu/lispm/lispm/mcasm/" asdf:*central-registry*)
  (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :mcasm)
  OR
  (require 'mcasm) [ only for sbcl ]

Enter the MCASM package (in SLIME REPL buffer):

  , change-package RET mcasm RET
  OR <RET>
  ,!p <RET> mcasm <RET>

Open and load microprogram source file:

  C-x C-f microprogram.lisp RET
  C-c C-l RET

Assemble it (from SLIME REPL buffer):

To make a microcode file for the simulator, use:
  (write-microprogram :output-format :simulator)

To make a microcode file for the emulator, use:

  (write-microprogram :output-format t)
